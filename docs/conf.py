# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.

# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# incremental builds.

# The version info for the project you're documenting, acts as replacement for
# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#

# Readthedocs largely ignores 'version' and 'release', and displays one of
# 'latest', tag name, or branch name, depending on the build type.
# Still, this is useful for non-RTD builds.
# This is supposed to be "the short X.Y version", but it's the only version
# visible when you open index.html.
# Display full version to make things less confusing.

# pixels large.
